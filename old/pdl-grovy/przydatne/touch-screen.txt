Enable touchscreen gestures in Linux Firefox

If you have a Tablet PC or Laptop with touchscreen on Linux you probably don't have the touchscreen gestures enabled. To enable them follow two simple steps:

    In Firefox open page about:config find the line dom.w3c_touch_events.enabled and set the value to 1.

    In file /etc/security/pam_env.conf add line (in the end of file) MOZ_USE_XINPUT2 DEFAULT=1 and reboot your machine
